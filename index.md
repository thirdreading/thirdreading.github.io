Learning from Data Beyond Financial Services
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

<br>

Data insights are critical within a wide range of sectors including the cybersecurity, healthcare & medicine, energy, space weather, and various areas of the public and third sectors.  Sometimes the organisations within these sectors

<ul>
<li>Are in search of similar insights or intelligence, e.g., cybersecurity intelligence that continuously outlines the resilience of their computer & software systems to attack.</li>

<li>Develop models, e.g., models that aid product or service improvement aims, that depend on data sets that might have similarities with the data sets that a financial firm might use to inform investment options.</li>

<li>Might use similar artificial intelligence/data science/machine learning techniques, and techniques from the areas of signal processing, management science, etc., to learn from data.</li>
</ul>
